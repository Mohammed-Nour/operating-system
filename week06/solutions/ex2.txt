conclusion:
 
Certainly, here's a combined comparison and explanation:

The primary distinction between using `TRI_BASE = 1000000` and `TRI_BASE = 100` lies in the range of computed triangular numbers for each process. With the first setting, `big_n` can range from 0 to 1,000,000, whereas in the second setting, `big_n` spans from 0 to 100.

When determining if a number is triangular, it necessitates O(n) time. Consequently, when `big_n` is large (1,000,000), the program must check a significantly greater number of triangular numbers compared to the case when `big_n` is limited to 100. In the former setting, the average number of checks is around 4, whereas in the latter case, it averages around 300 (with some degree of randomness).

Now, when it comes to the arrival times of processes, this can significantly impact the execution order and, subsequently, the performance metrics. 

**When all processes start at time 0**, they have equal priority, and the scheduler executes them in the order they were read, adhering to the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) principle. This leads to an average waiting time of approximately 13.43 and an average turnaround time of 17.71. Each process is treated fairly and sequentially.

**In contrast, when processes have different arrival times**, the scheduler respects these arrival times. As a result, processes that arrive earlier are given priority. The average waiting time is lower, at around 8.0, and the average turnaround time is also reduced to approximately 12.29. 

The key difference here is the impact of arrival times on process execution order. In FCFS, processes are executed in the order they are read. But when processes have different arrival times, the scheduler respects the order in which they arrive, giving priority to earlier arrivals. This can significantly affect the average waiting and turnaround times, favoring processes that arrive earlier.
