In summary, the Random algorithm shows a clear disadvantage in environments where
the page access pattern is not uniformly random, which is typical
in most real-world scenarios. Both NFU and Aging outperform Random
by leveraging access history to make more informed decisions on page eviction,
resulting in a higher hit ratio and fewer disk accesses.
The identical performance between NFU and Aging suggests that
the test case may not have been able to highlight the difference
between these two algorithms, or the implementation specifics did not
differentiate enough between 'frequently used' and 'recently used' pages.
To better distinguish between NFU and Aging, you might need to create a reference
string with a greater range of access patterns or run the simulation for a longer period.
