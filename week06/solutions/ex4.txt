conclusion:  
 Based on the provided data, we can compare the three scheduling algorithms – FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve), FJS (First-Job-First-Serve, which is usually referred to as SJF or Shortest Job First), and Round-Robin. 

1. **FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve):**
   - **Average Waiting Time (avg_wt)**: 8.000000
   - **Average Turnaround Time (avg_tat)**: 12.285714
   
2. **FJS (First-Job-First-Serve) or SJF (Shortest Job First):**
   - **Average Waiting Time (avg_wt)**: 4.857143
   - **Average Turnaround Time (avg_tat)**: 9.142858
   
3. **Round-Robin:**
   - **Average Waiting Time (avg_wt)**: 9.000000
   - **Average Turnaround Time (avg_tat)**: 13.285714

### Comparative Analysis:

1. **Average Waiting Time:**
   - FJS/SJF has the lowest average waiting time of 4.857143.
   - FCFS is in the middle with an average waiting time of 8.000000.
   - Round-Robin has the highest average waiting time of 9.000000.
   
2. **Average Turnaround Time:**
   - FJS/SJF also leads in this category with the lowest average turnaround time of 9.142858.
   - FCFS follows with 12.285714.
   - Round-Robin lags behind with the highest average turnaround time of 13.285714.

### Observations:

1. **FJS/SJF (Shortest Job First):** This algorithm is performing best in this set of processes, both in terms of average waiting time and average turnaround time. This can be attributed to its nature of executing the shortest job available first, leading to faster completion times for shorter tasks.

2. **FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve):** Being a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm, processes execute in the order they arrive. In this set of processes, it has a moderate performance in terms of both waiting and turnaround times.

3. **Round-Robin:** Despite being a preemptive scheduling algorithm where every process is assigned a fixed time in cyclic order, it performs the worst among the three for this specific set of processes. The waiting and turnaround times are highest. However, it's important to note that performance in Round-Robin can significantly vary based on the time quantum chosen. The data provided seems to suggest an improperly set time quantum or possible errors, especially given the negative waiting and turnaround times for some processes which is unrealistic.

### Conclusion:

For the specific data set given:
- **FJS/SJF** is the most efficient in terms of average waiting and turnaround times.
- **FCFS** has a moderate performance.
- **Round-Robin** lags in efficiency, but the results might be improved with a different time quantum or ensuring that the calculations are accurate. 

However, it's important to note that these conclusions might change with different process data sets or varying conditions. Each algorithm has its pros and cons and might be more suitable in different scenarios.
